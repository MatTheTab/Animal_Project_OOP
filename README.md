# Animal_Project_OOP
C++ project for object oriented programming classes. It is meant to be a simple simulation of the natural world coded according to specifications of object oriented programming. The program is coded in such a way that every animal species is represented as a class, this includes hierarchy of classes, for example "Lion" is a subclass
of class "Mammal", etc. Animals can die and reproduce, producing new object instances. The simulation finishes when the number of animals reaches a specified limit- by default 100 animals.
